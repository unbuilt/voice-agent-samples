# LangGraph Handoff — Responses Protocol (VoiceLive)

Multi-agent customer support handoff demo using LangGraph, served as a hosted agent through the Responses protocol. Optimized for voice-first scenarios.

## Architecture

Three specialized agents with handoff:

- **Triage Agent** — Routes requests to the appropriate specialist
- **Refund Agent** — Handles refund requests (lookup order, submit refund)
- **Order Agent** — Handles replacements/exchanges (submit replacement)

Agents transfer control via handoff tools. Status updates stream in real-time as agents hand off and tools execute.

## Local Development

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Foundry project endpoint (auto-injected in hosted containers) |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | Yes | Model deployment name in the Foundry project |

#### Run Locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### Test

```bash
# Streaming
curl -sS -N -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"input": "I need a refund for order 12345", "stream": true}'
```

## Using [`azd`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=azd) (recommended for CLI workflows)

No cloning required. Create a new folder, point azd at the manifest on GitHub, and it sets up the sample and generates Bicep infrastructure, agent.yaml, and env config automatically:

```bash
# Create a new folder for the agent and navigate into it
mkdir handoff-langgraph-agent && cd handoff-langgraph-agent

# Initialize from the manifest — azd reads it, downloads the sample,
# and generates Bicep infrastructure, agent.yaml, and env config
azd ai agent init -m path/to/agent.manifest.yaml

# Provision Azure resources (Foundry project, model deployment, App Insights)
azd provision

# Run the agent locally (handles env vars, dependency install, and startup)
azd ai agent run
```

The agent starts on http://localhost:8088/. To invoke it:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "I need a refund for order 12345"
```
### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

Once you've tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
# Provision Azure resources (skip if already done during local setup)
azd provision

# Build, push, and deploy the agent to Foundry
azd deploy
```

After deploying, invoke the agent running in Foundry:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "I need a refund for order 12345"
```

To stream logs from the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor
```
